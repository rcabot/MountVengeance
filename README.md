# Mount Vengeance
We built on hallowed ground, now the golems of the mountain come to wrought their pyroclastic vengeance! 
As a lone shield-warrior, defend what is left of the mountain hamlet - how long can you last?

# About
This is a small Breakout-style game project testing out the features of sfml.
This version is a proof of concept and so there are some missing sprites and graphics.

# How to play
The golems are attacking the village! 
-- fiery golems will shoot magma projectiles at you, but... 
-- you can reflect them back with your shield (move with arrow keys)
-- reflected projectiles will destroy golems
-- however, they will also destroy your houses, so be careful!
-- you will lose if all the houses are destroyed (press R to reset)
-- golems may also recall their projectiles, and fire them at you again!
-- more and more fire golems will spawn each level, with more projectiles to protect from!
-- how long can you survive?
